# Amazing Digital Cinema

A curated list of resources for film technicians in the fields of digital cinema content mastering, delivery, archiving and exhibition.

Please contribute to this list!

If you don't know how to contribute on GitHub, please follow this [guide](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/04/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/) and the [guidelines](https://github.com/4lm/amazing-digital-cinema/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of this repository. If this is too much of an effort for you to learn, but you still want to contribute, then [post an issue](https://github.com/4lm/amazing-digital-cinema/issues) here on Github with your suggestion(s) for adding to the list.

This list was inspired by the [awesome-broadcasting list](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting). Which itself was inspired by the awesome [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
In contrast, this list also lists non open-source resources. To reflect this matter and out of respect towards the open-source only awesome list projects, I named this list amazing digital cinema instead of awesome digital cinema.

# Amazing Digital Cinema

A curated list of resources for film technicians in the areas of mastering, delivering, archiving, and exhibiting digital film content.

**Please feel free to contribute to this list!**

If you don't know how to contribute on GitHub, follow this [guide](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/04/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/) and the [guidelines](https://github.com/4lm/amazing-digital-cinema/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of this repository. If this is too much effort for you to learn, but you still want to contribute, [post an issue](https://github.com/4lm/amazing-digital-cinema/issues) here on GitHub with your suggestion(s) for adding to the list.

This list was inspired by the [awesome-broadcasting list](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting), which itself was inspired by the awesome [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). In contrast, this list also lists non open-source resources. To reflect this matter and out of respect towards the open-source only awesome list projects, I named this list "Amazing" Digital Cinema instead of "Awesome" Digital Cinema.
